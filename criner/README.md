[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crates-io/criner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/crates-io/criner)

## Tasks

* [ ] investigate if negation patterns (-> `!foo.rs`) can be used and to what extent.
* [ ] resilience: protect against ThreadPanics - they prevent the program from shutting down
   * Futures has a wrapper to catch panics, even though we don't use it yet. A panic only brings down the future that panics, not the entire program.
* [ ] Graceful shutdown on Ctrl+C
  * The current implementation relies on the database to handle aborted writes, and is no problem for that reason. However, it would be nice to have
    A well-behaving program.

## Lessons learned

* futures::ThreadPools - panicking futures crash only one thread
* long-running futures need error and potentially panic recovery. Futures has a panick catcher that could be useful.
* async_std channel blocks if there is no receiver, which can definitely bite you if your processors are down. Also I don't know why this is desirable behaviour.
* sqlite needs a lot of massaging to work acceptably in concurrent applications. Takeaway: WAL_mode, and when writting, always use immediate transactions
  when writing. Retry yourself while waiting and set a busy handler which waits.

### When migrating to Sqlite

* sqliteâ€¦
  * is really not suited for many concurrent writers - you have to prepare for database locked errors, and the busy_handler doesn't help most of the time.
  * writing many small objects is slow, and can only be alleviated with prepared statements which are not always feasible or nice to use with a persistence
    design inspired by sled. To alleviate, the whole application must embrace Sqlite and work with statements directly.
  * Working with the lifetimes associated with transactions is a necessary evil, but it is painful too when trying to refactor anything! I just don't understand
    anymore what it tries to do, and have the feeling the compiler is confused itself (as in theory, there is no issue).
* sled databases are about 4 times bigger than an Sqlite database with the same content, and it would read about 1.2GB of a 14GB database at startup.
* sled is easy to handle in a threaded/concurrent environment, but iteration isn't possible across awaits as it's not sync
  * Sqlite is not sync nor is it send, so it needs more treatment before it can be used with spawened futures
* Zero-copy is straigforward with Sled as it provides IVec structs, which are handles into an LRU which is the backing store.
  * In retrospect, I would consider zero-copy a nice experiment, but also a premature optimization. It costs additinoal effort
    and when done from the beginning, you don't even know how much time is actually saved through that.
